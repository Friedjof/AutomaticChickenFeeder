# Chicken Feeding Guide (freerange-oriented)

Quick facts and recommended defaults for the automatic feeder. Values assume 2.0–2.5 kg freerange hens with good outdoor access.

## Daily intake
- Freerange hens self-forage 20–50%; target **80–120 g complete feed per day** (up to ~130 g for high layers).
- Winter: +10–20% for warmth. Small breeds/chicks need less; adjust per weight.

## Feed choice
- Use **layer/land hen complete feed** (~16% protein, 3.5–4% calcium, grain base ~60%, plant protein ~20%, fiber).
- Always provide grit (gastroliths) and oyster shell free choice.
- Keep raw fruit/veg treats under 10% of ration to avoid diluting nutrients.

| Feed type      | Typical composition                    | Fits for                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Layer meal/mash| ~60% grain, ~20% protein, ~4% Ca       | Freerange layers (main feed)  |
| Grain mix      | Cracked corn, oats, rye                | Supplemental scratch in run   |
| Complete feed  | 16% protein, ~11 MJ/kg ME              | Main hopper/automatic feeder  |

## Feeding times (automated)
- **2–3 drops/day**:  
  - Morning pre-range: 60–70% of daily ration around sunrise.  
  - Midday: small top-up ~3 h later.  
  - Evening: small top-up after laying, before dusk.
- Prefer short block feedings; avoid leaving full troughs all day (reduces selective picking).
- Sync timers to sunrise/sunset (e.g., Munich: ~8:00 winter, ~5:00 summer); add ~20% in winter.

## Software tips for the feeder
- **Portions**: Start with 40–60 g morning, 20–30 g noon/evening; let users adjust per flock size/weight.
- **Timers**: Support location-based sunrise times + seasonal multiplier (+20% winter). Consider a “daily empty” check via weight sensor to prevent stale feed.
- **Onboarding**: First week allow manual scatter, vary amounts; add humidity alert for feed spoilage risk.
- **Monitoring**: Track daily intake toward 120 g/hen; warn below ~80 g. Optionally correlate with lay rate to nudge portions up for high performers.
