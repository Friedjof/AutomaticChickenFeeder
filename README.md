### 3D Printed Components
> Note: STL files for 3D printing will be available shortly.

This section outlines the key 3D printed components essential for assembling the automatic chicken feeder. These parts have been meticulously designed to ensure easy assembly and efficient operation of the feeder.

- **Funnel at the top**: Serves as the primary entry point for the feed, guiding it smoothly into the system.
- **Spreading Disc**: A critical component responsible for evenly distributing the feed.
- **Spreading Disc Holder**: Provides stable support to the spreading disc, ensuring reliable operation.
- **Distance Holder**: Aids in maintaining the correct spacing between various components.
- **Battery Pack Holder**: Securely houses the battery, ensuring a consistent power supply.
- **Allen Wrench**: A tool included for easy assembly and adjustment of the components.

Each component plays a vital role in the functionality of the feeder, contributing to its overall effectiveness and ease of use.

The image illustrates the key components of the feeder: the funnel, spreading disc, spreading disc holder, and distance holder. Centrally located, an Allen wrench is utilized to securely attach the spreading disc to the motor.

## The Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to manage your chicken feeder. Here are its main features:

- **Settings**: You can set up to 4 timers, each with its own feed quantity. This allows you to customize the feeding schedule to suit your chickens' needs. You can also set the time and day of the week for each timer, allowing for a feeding schedule that spans multiple days.

- **Timer Activation/Deactivation**: Each timer can be individually activated or deactivated. This gives you the flexibility to temporarily disable a feeding without deleting the timer.

- **Manual Feeding**: In addition to the scheduled feedings, you can also trigger a manual feeding at any time.

- **Export Settings**: You can export your settings for backup or for use on another device. This creates a .csv file that can be imported back into the web interface.

- **Time Synchronization**: The time on your browser is automatically synchronized with the real-time clock (RTC) on the chicken feeder when you access the web interface.

- **Current Time Display**: The web interface displays the current time, updated every second. This allows you to easily check the time and ensure that the feeding schedule is running as expected.

> Note: While the images show the web interface being accessed via `localhost:5000`, this is for development purposes only. In a production environment, the web interface can be accessed via the IP address `192.168.4.1`.

## Installation and Configuration
1. Clone this repository.
2. Rename `data/config.json-template` to `data/config.json` and change the default values to your preferences.
```bash
mv data/config.json-template data/config.json
```
3. Install dependencies (VSCode extension PlatformIO IDE and PlatformIO Core).
4. Configure the `platformio.ini` file to select the correct board and port, or start a Nix shell.

```bash
nix-shell
```

## Usage Instructions for ESP in Access Point Mode
When operating the ESP in Access Point mode, it generates a dedicated WiFi network. To access the ESP's web server, use the following default IP address: http://192.168.4.1. Simply open a web browser and input this IP address to interact with the web services and functionalities offered by the ESP32.

### ESP32 Microcontroller Pinout
The table below details the pinout configuration of the ESP32 microcontroller. Please note that the pinout for the DS3231 RTC module and the motor control module may differ based on the manufacturer's specifications.

| ESP32S3 | ESP32DEV | RTC | Motor   |
| ------- | -------- | --- | ------- |
| 4       | 21       | SDA | -       |
| 5       | 22       | SCL | -       |
| 7       | 4        | INT | -       |
| 8       | 2        | -   | CONTROL |
| 3.3V    | 3.3V     | VCC | VCC     |
| GND     | GND      | GND | GND     |

### Flashing Firmware from the Release Section
> Before proceeding, it's essential to create your own littlefs.bin file. For guidance on building this file, refer to the section about the [Makefile](#build-the-project-with-the-makefile). Without this, the configuration file will be absent, leading to improper functioning of the system.

In the release section, the latest firmware binaries for the microcontrollers are available. Use the commands below to flash these binaries onto the ESP32DEV or ESP32S3 microcontroller.

**First, you must install the `esptool`:**

```bash
pip install esptool
```

> Note: Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running the above command.

#### firmware.bin, bootloader.bin and partitions.bin (ESP32)
```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x1000 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
```
Change the `--port` parameter to match your system configuration and the path to the binary files.

#### firmware.bin (ESP8266)
```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x10000 firmware.bin
```
Change the `--port` parameter to match your system configuration and the path to the binary files.

#### littlefs.bin (ESP32 and ESP8266)
```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x290000 littlefs.bin
```
Change the `--port` parameter to match your system configuration and the path to the binary files.
